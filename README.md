## 🧹 Data Preparation – Power Query

**Power Query** was used for:

* Importing raw sales data
* Removing unnecessary columns
* Handling missing values
* Correcting data types
* Cleaning inconsistent data
* Transforming columns
* Preparing data for the data model

This creates a clean and structured dataset before analysis.

---

## 🗂️ Data Model – Power Pivot

The cleaned data was loaded into **Power Pivot** to create a reusable data model.

### Main Data

The model contains important fields such as:

* Order ID
* Order Date
* Ship Date
* Customer
* Segment
* Region
* Category
* Sub-Category
* Product
* Sales
* Quantity
* Discount
* Profit

The data model allows relationships and calculations to be used efficiently across PivotTables and dashboard visualizations.

---

## 🧮 DAX Measures

DAX measures were created in Power Pivot to calculate important business KPIs.

### Total Sales

```DAX
Total Sales = SUM(Sales[Sales])
```

### Total Profit

```DAX
Total Profit = SUM(Sales[Profit])
```

### Total Quantity

```DAX
Total Quantity = SUM(Sales[Quantity])
```

### Total Orders

```DAX
Total Orders = DISTINCTCOUNT(Sales[Order ID])
```

### Profit Margin

```DAX
Profit Margin = DIVIDE([Total Profit], [Total Sales], 0)
```

### Average Sales

```DAX
Average Sales = AVERAGE(Sales[Sales])
```

> **Note:** Replace `Sales` with the actual table name used in the workbook if your Power Pivot table has a different name.
